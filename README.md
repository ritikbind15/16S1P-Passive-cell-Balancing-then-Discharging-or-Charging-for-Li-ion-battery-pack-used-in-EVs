# 16S1P-Passive-cell-Balancing-then-Discharging-or-Charging-for-Li-ion-battery-pack-used-in-EVs
This repository contains the simulation and control implementation of passive cell balancing followed by discharging or charging, based on the Minimum State of Charge (Min SoC) strategy, for a 16S1P lithium-ion battery pack commonly used in electric vehicles (EVs).It focuses on enhancing battery safety, lifespan, and efficiency by addressing the issue of cell voltage or state-of-charge (SoC) imbalance in a series-connected battery configuration.


üìå Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Ensure all cells in the series configuration reach a balanced state before the main charging or discharging process begins.

Use Min SoC-based logic to prevent over-discharge of weaker cells during pack operation.

Simulate safe, efficient, and reliable battery operation using passive balancing techniques.

‚öôÔ∏è System Configuration
Battery Type: Li-ion

Pack Configuration: 16S1P (16 cells in series, 1 parallel)

Balancing Type: Passive (resistive discharge method)

Balancing Trigger: Before pack discharge/charge

Balancing Strategy: Higher SoC cells are discharged down to the SoC of the weakest cell (Min SoC)

Simulation Tool: MATLAB/Simulink



üß† Methodology
Initial Condition:

All 16 cells have different initial SoC levels (non-uniform).

Passive Cell Balancing:

Cells with SoC higher than the minimum SoC are discharged using resistors until all cells are at or near the same SoC level.

Post-Balancing Operation:

Once balanced, the pack undergoes either:

Discharging (e.g., during EV operation), or

Charging (e.g., regenerative braking or plug-in charging)

Monitoring:

Includes basic protection against under-voltage and over-voltage.



üìä Simulation Results
Before Balancing: SoC values across cells are scattered.

After Balancing: All cells are nearly equal to the minimum SoC.

Post-Balancing Operation: Smooth and safe discharge/charge with reduced risk of cell mismatch or damage.
